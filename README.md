# What I Learn Here

## 1.seen[i] = 1
  seen[i] = 1 marks the element i as encountered by setting its value in the seen dictionary to 1
    ex: seen={2:1,3:1,2:1}
  Refer:287

## 2.nums[:]
   means updating the entire list nums in place, preserving the original list object.
   So we don't need to create a variable
   Refer:26

## 3.enumerate
  enumerate creates a list to index value & value like dict
    ex: A=[Apple,Car,Cat]
        A=[(0,Apple),(1,Car),(2,Cat)]
